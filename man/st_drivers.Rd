}
\description{
Get a list of the available GDAL drivers
}
\details{
The drivers available will depend on the installation of GDAL/OGR, and can vary; the \code{st_drivers()} function shows which are available, and which may be written (but all are assumed to be readable). Note that stray files in data source directories (such as *.dbf) may lead to suprious errors that accompanying *.shp are missing.
